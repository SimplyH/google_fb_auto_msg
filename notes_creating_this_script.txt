notes creating this script.txt

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
1. always build new directory with bundle gem
	see: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/04/08/how-to-build-a-ruby-gem-with-bundler-test-driven-development-travis-ci-and-coveralls-oh-my/

	Then you will get a logical folder structure


2. configure SUBLIME to always save by default the folder
  - cmd + shift + p
  - search for user
  - copy paste this script:

  {
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
  "folder_exclude_patterns":
  [
    ".svn",
    ".hg",
    "CVS",
    "tmp/cache",
    ".html"
  ],
  "font_size": 17,
  "ignored_packages":
  [
    "Vintage"
  ],
  "save_on_focus_lost": true,
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "trim_automatic_white_space:": true,
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true
}

3. Nokogiri breaks
  - brew is missing, use this line to install Homebrew first:
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

4. if require doesn't work, try
  - require_relative
      it starts in the path of this file

THE SCRIPT ITSELF
2. Import results from Google Form into array
	- Google has a Google Spreadsheets API
		- probably use that for import, because results are pushed in there
	- Apigee: https://apigee.com/resources/google-spreadsheets
	- Search rubygems.org for potential gems
		- there are some specific ones like http://rubygems.org/gems/parallel588_google_drive
			- but they only have a few thousand downloads

		- there is Google Drive with hundreds of thousands of downloads
